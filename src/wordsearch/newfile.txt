ALMOST A DECADE HAS passed since this book was first published. As I mention in the original
introduction, the opportunity to write the book came while I was in law school, the result of my election as
the first African-American president of the Harvard Law Review. In the wake of some modest publicity, I
received an advance from a publisher and went to work with the belief that the story of my family, and my
efforts to understand that story, might speak in some way to the fissures of race that have characterized the
American experience, as well as the fluid state of identity-the leaps through time, the collision of culturesthat
mark our modern life.
 Like most first-time authors, I was filled with hope and despair upon the book’s publication-hope that
the book might succeed beyond my youthful dreams, despair that I had failed to say anything worth saying.
The reality fell somewhere in between. The reviews were mildly favorable. People actually showed up at the
readings my publisher arranged. The sales were underwhelming. And, after a few months, I went on with
the business of my life, certain that my career as an author would be short-lived, but glad to have survived
the process with my dignity more or less intact.
 I had little time for reflection over the next ten years. I ran a voter registration project in the 1992
election cycle, began a civil rights practice, and started teaching constitutional law at the University of
Chicago. My wife and I bought a house, were blessed with two gorgeous, healthy, and mischievous
daughters, and struggled to pay the bills. When a seat in the state legislature opened up in 1996, some
friends persuaded me to run for the office, and I won. I had been warned, before taking office, that state
politics lacks the glamour of its Washington counterpart; one labors largely in obscurity, mostly on topics
that mean a great deal to some but that the average man or woman on the street can safely ignore (the
regulation of mobile homes, say, or the tax consequences of farm equipment depreciation). Nonetheless, I
found the work satisfying, mostly because the scale of state politics allows for concrete results-an
expansion of health insurance for poor children, or a reform of laws that send innocent men to death rowwithin
a meaningful time frame. And too, because within the capitol building of a big, industrial state, one
sees every day the face of a nation in constant conversation: inner-city mothers and corn and bean farmers,
immigrant day laborers alongside suburban investment bankers-all jostling to be heard, all ready to tell their
stories.
 A few months ago, I won the Democratic nomination for a seat as the U.S. senator from Illinois. It was
a difficult race, in a crowded field of well-funded, skilled, and prominent candidates; without organizational
backing or personal wealth, a black man with a funny name, I was considered a long shot. And so, when I
won a majority of the votes in the Democratic primary, winning in white areas as well as black, in the
suburbs as well as Chicago, the reaction that followed echoed the response to my election to the Law
Review. Mainstream commentators expressed surprise and genuine hope that my victory signaled a
broader change in our racial politics. Within the black community, there was a sense of pride regarding my
accomplishment, a pride mingled with frustration that fifty years after Brown v. Board of Education and forty
years after the passage of the Voting Rights Act, we should still be celebrating the possibility (and only the 
possibility, for I have a tough general election coming up) that I might be the sole African American-and only
the third since Reconstruction-to serve in the Senate. My family, friends, and I were mildly bewildered by the
attention, and constantly aware of the gulf between the hard sheen of media reports and the messy,
mundane realities of life as it is truly lived.
 Just as that spate of publicity prompted my publisher’s interest a decade ago, so has this fresh round
of news clippings encouraged the book’s re-publication. For the first time in many years, I’ve pulled out a
copy and read a few chapters to see how much my voice may have changed over time. I confess to wincing
every so often at a poorly chosen word, a mangled sentence, an expression of emotion that seems
indulgent or overly practiced. I have the urge to cut the book by fifty pages or so, possessed as I am with a
keener appreciation for brevity. I cannot honestly say, however, that the voice in this book is not mine-that I
would tell the story much differently today than I did ten years ago, even if certain passages have proven to
be inconvenient politically, the grist for pundit commentary and opposition research.
 What has changed, of course, dramatically, decisively, is the context in which the book might now be
read. I began writing against a backdrop of Silicon Valley and a booming stock market; the collapse of the
Berlin Wall; Mandela-in slow, sturdy steps-emerging from prison to lead a country; the signing of peace
accords in Oslo. Domestically, our cultural debates-around guns and abortion and rap lyrics-seemed so
fierce precisely because Bill Clinton’s Third Way, a scaled-back welfare state without grand ambition but
without sharp edges, seemed to describe a broad, underlying consensus on bread-and-butter issues, a
consensus to which even George W. Bush’s first campaign, with its “compassionate conservatism,” would
have to give a nod. Internationally, writers announced the end of history, the ascendance of free markets
and liberal democracy, the replacement of old hatreds and wars between nations with virtual communities
and battles for market share.
 And then, on September 11, 2001, the world fractured.
 It’s beyond my skill as a writer to capture that day, and the days that would follow-the planes, like
specters, vanishing into steel and glass; the slow-motion cascade of the towers crumbling into themselves;
the ash-covered figures wandering the streets; the anguish and the fear. Nor do I pretend to understand the
stark nihilism that drove the terrorists that day and that drives their brethren still. My powers of empathy, my
ability to reach into another’s heart, cannot penetrate the blank stares of those who would murder innocents
with abstract, serene satisfaction.
 What I do know is that history returned that day with a vengeance; that, in fact, as Faulkner reminds
us, the past is never dead and buried-it isn’t even past. This collective history, this past, directly touches my
own. Not merely because the bombs of Al Qaeda have marked, with an eerie precision, some of the
landscapes of my life-the buildings and roads and faces of Nairobi, Bali, Manhattan; not merely because, as
a consequence of 9/11, my name is an irresistible target of mocking websites from overzealous Republican
operatives. But also because the underlying struggle-between worlds of plenty and worlds of want; between
the modern and the ancient; between those who embrace our teeming, colliding, irksome diversity, while
still insisting on a set of values that binds us together, and those who would seek, under whatever flag or
slogan or sacred text, a certainty and simplification that justifies cruelty toward those not like us-is the
struggle set forth, on a miniature scale, in this book.
 I know, I have seen, the desperation and disorder of the powerless: how it twists the lives of children
on the streets of Jakarta or Nairobi in much the same way as it does the lives of children on Chicago’s
South Side, how narrow the path is for them between humiliation and untrammeled fury, how easily they slip
into violence and despair. I know that the response of the powerful to this disorder-alternating as it does
between a dull complacency and, when the disorder spills out of its proscribed confines, a steady,
unthinking application of force, of longer prison sentences and more sophisticated military hardware-is
inadequate to the task. I know that the hardening of lines, the embrace of fundamentalism and tribe, dooms
us all.
 And so what was a more interior, intimate effort on my part, to understand this struggle and to find my
place in it, has converged with a broader public debate, a debate in which I am professionally engaged, one
that will shape our lives and the lives of our children for many years to come.
 The policy implications of all this are a topic for another book. Let me end instead on a more personal
note. Most of the characters in this book remain a part of my life, albeit in varying degrees-a function of
work, children, geography, and turns of fate.
 The exception is my mother, whom we lost, with a brutal swiftness, to cancer a few months after this
book was published. 
 She had spent the previous ten years doing what she loved. She traveled the world, working in the
distant villages of Asia and Africa, helping women buy a sewing machine or a milk cow or an education that
might give them a foothold in the world’s economy. She gathered friends from high and low, took long
walks, stared at the moon, and foraged through the local markets of Delhi or Marrakesh for some trifle, a
scarf or stone carving that would make her laugh or please the eye. She wrote reports, read novels,
pestered her children, and dreamed of grandchildren.
 We saw each other frequently, our bond unbroken. During the writing of this book, she would read the
drafts, correcting stories that I had misunderstood, careful not to comment on my characterizations of her
but quick to explain or defend the less flattering aspects of my father’s character. She managed her illness
with grace and good humor, and she helped my sister and me push on with our lives, despite our dread, our
denials, our sudden constrictions of the heart.
 I think sometimes that had I known she would not survive her illness, I might have written a different
book-less a meditation on the absent parent, more a celebration of the one who was the single constant in
my life. In my daughters I see her every day, her joy, her capacity for wonder. I won’t try to describe how
deeply I mourn her passing still. I know that she was the kindest, most generous spirit I have ever known,
and that what is best in me I owe to her.


 INTRODUCTION

 I ORIGINALLY INTENDED A VERY different book. The opportunity to write it first arose while I was still
in law school, after my election as the first black president of the Harvard Law Review, a legal periodical
largely unknown outside the profession. A burst of publicity followed that election, including several
newspaper articles that testified less to my modest accomplishments than to Harvard Law School’s peculiar
place in the American mythology, as well as America’s hunger for any optimistic sign from the racial front-a
morsel of proof that, after all, some progress has been made. A few publishers called, and I, imagining
myself to have something original to say about the current state of race relations, agreed to take off a year
after graduation and put my thoughts to paper.
 In that last year of law school, I began to organize in my mind, with a frightening confidence, just how
the book would proceed. There would be an essay on the limits of civil rights litigation in bringing about
racial equality, thoughts on the meaning of community and the restoration of public life through grassroots
organizing, musings on affirmative action and Afrocentrism-the list of topics filled an entire page. I’d include
personal anecdotes, to be sure, and analyze the sources of certain recurring emotions. But all in all it was
an intellectual journey that I imagined for myself, complete with maps and restpoints and a strict itinerary:
the first section completed by March, the second submitted for revision in August….
 When I actually sat down and began to write, though, I found my mind pulled toward rockier shores.
First longings leapt up to brush my heart. Distant voices appeared, and ebbed, and then appeared again. I
remembered the stories that my mother and her parents told me as a child, the stories of a family trying to
explain itself. I recalled my first year as a community organizer in Chicago and my awkward steps toward
manhood. I listened to my grandmother, sitting under a mango tree as she braided my sister’s hair,
describing the father I had never truly known.
 Compared to this flood of memories, all my well-ordered theories seemed insubstantial and premature.
Still, I strongly resisted the idea of offering up my past in a book, a past that left me feeling exposed, even
slightly ashamed. Not because that past is particularly painful or perverse but because it speaks to those
aspects of myself that resist conscious choice and that-on the surface, at least-contradict the world I now
occupy. After all, I’m thirty-three now; I work as a lawyer active in the social and political life of Chicago, a
town that’s accustomed to its racial wounds and prides itself on a certain lack of sentiment. If I’ve been able
to fight off cynicism, I nevertheless like to think of myself as wise to the world, careful not to expect too
much.
 And yet what strikes me most when I think about the story of my family is a running strain of innocence,
an innocence that seems unimaginable, even by the measures of childhood. My wife’s cousin, only six
years old, has already lost such innocence: A few weeks ago he reported to his parents that some of his
first grade classmates had refused to play with him because of his dark, unblemished skin. Obviously his
parents, born and raised in Chicago and Gary, lost their own innocence long ago, and although they aren’t 
bitter-the two of them being as strong and proud and resourceful as any parents I know-one hears the pain
in their voices as they begin to have second thoughts about having moved out of the city into a mostly white
suburb, a move they made to protect their son from the possibility of being caught in a gang shooting and
the certainty of attending an underfunded school.
 They know too much, we have all seen too much, to take my parents’ brief union-a black man and
white woman, an African and an American-at face value. As a result, some people have a hard time taking
me at face value. When people who don’t know me well, black or white, discover my background (and it is
usually a discovery, for I ceased to advertise my mother’s race at the age of twelve or thirteen, when I
began to suspect that by doing so I was ingratiating myself to whites), I see the split-second adjustments
they have to make, the searching of my eyes for some telltale sign. They no longer know who I am.
Privately, they guess at my troubled heart, I suppose-the mixed blood, the divided soul, the ghostly image of
the tragic mulatto trapped between two worlds. And if I were to explain that no, the tragedy is not mine, or at
least not mine alone, it is yours, sons and daughters of Plymouth Rock and Ellis Island, it is yours, children
of Africa, it is the tragedy of both my wife’s six-year-old cousin and his white first grade classmates, so that
you need not guess at what troubles me, it’s on the nightly news for all to see, and that if we could
acknowledge at least that much then the tragic cycle begins to break down…well, I suspect that I sound
incurably naive, wedded to lost hopes, like those Communists who peddle their newspapers on the fringes
of various college towns. Or worse, I sound like I’m trying to hide from myself.
 I don’t fault people their suspicions. I learned long ago to distrust my childhood and the stories that
shaped it. It was only many years later, after I had sat at my father’s grave and spoken to him through
Africa’s red soil, that I could circle back and evaluate these early stories for myself. Or, more accurately, it
was only then that I understood that I had spent much of my life trying to rewrite these stories, plugging up
holes in the narrative, accommodating unwelcome details, projecting individual choices against the blind
sweep of history, all in the hope of extracting some granite slab of truth upon which my unborn children can
firmly stand.
 At some point, then, in spite of a stubborn desire to protect myself from scrutiny, in spite of the periodic
impulse to abandon the entire project, what has found its way onto these pages is a record of a personal,
interior journey-a boy’s search for his father, and through that search a workable meaning for his life as a
black American. The result is autobiographical, although whenever someone’s asked me over the course of
these last three years just what the book is about, I’ve usually avoided such a description. An autobiography
promises feats worthy of record, conversations with famous people, a central role in important events.
There is none of that here. At the very least, an autobiography implies a summing up, a certain closure, that
hardly suits someone of my years, still busy charting his way through the world. I can’t even hold up my
experience as being somehow representative of the black American experience (“After all, you don’t come
from an underprivileged background,” a Manhattan publisher helpfully points out to me); indeed, learning to
accept that particular truth-that I can embrace my black brothers and sisters, whether in this country or in
Africa, and affirm a common destiny without pretending to speak to, or for, all our various struggles-is part of
what this book’s about.
 Finally, there are the dangers inherent in any autobiographical work: the temptation to color events in
ways favorable to the writer, the tendency to overestimate the interest one’s experiences hold for others,
selective lapses of memory. Such hazards are only magnified when the writer lacks the wisdom of age; the
distance that can cure one of certain vanities. I can’t say that I’ve avoided all, or any, of these hazards
successfully. Although much of this book is based on contemporaneous journals or the oral histories of my
family, the dialogue is necessarily an approximation of what was actually said or relayed to me. For the
sake of compression, some of the characters that appear are composites of people I’ve known, and some
events appear out of precise chronology. With the exception of my family and a handful of public figures, the
names of most characters have been changed for the sake of their privacy.
 Whatever the label that attaches to this book-autobiography, memoir, family history, or something elsewhat
I’ve tried to do is write an honest account of a particular province of my life. When I’ve strayed, I’ve
been able to look to my agent, Jane Dystel, for her faith and tenacity; to my editor, Henry Ferris, for his
gentle but firm correctives; to Ruth Fecych and the staff at Times Books, for their enthusiasm and attention
in shepherding the manuscript through its various stages; to my friends, especially Robert Fisher, for their
generous readings; and to my wonderful wife, Michelle, for her wit, grace, candor, and unerring ability to
encourage my best impulses. 
 It is to my family, though-my mother, my grandparents, my siblings, stretched across oceans and
continents-that I owe the deepest gratitude and to whom I dedicate this book. Without their constant love
and support, without their willingness to let me sing their song and their toleration of the occasional wrong
note, I could never have hoped to finish. If nothing else, I hope that the love and respect I feel for them
shines through on every page.



 CHAPTER ONE

 A FEW MONTHS AFTER MY twenty-first birthday, a stranger called to give me the news. I was living
in New York at the time, on Ninety-fourth between Second and First, part of that unnamed, shifting border
between East Harlem and the rest of Manhattan. It was an uninviting block, treeless and barren, lined with
soot-colored walk-ups that cast heavy shadows for most of the day. The apartment was small, with slanting
floors and irregular heat and a buzzer downstairs that didn’t work, so that visitors had to call ahead from a
pay phone at the corner gas station,  a black Doberman the size of a wolf paced through the night in
vigilant patrol, its jaws clamped around an empty beer bottle.
 None of this concerned me much, for I didn’t get many visitors. I was impatient in those days, busy with
work and unrealized plans, and prone to see other people as unnecessary distractions. It wasn’t that I didn’t
appreciate company exactly. I enjoyed exchanging Spanish pleasantries with my mostly Puerto Rican
neighbors, and on my way back from classes I’d usually stop to talk to the boys who hung out on the stoop
all summer long about the Knicks or the gunshots they’d heard the night before. When the weather was
good, my roommate and I might sit out on the fire escape to smoke cigarettes and study the dusk washing
blue over the city, or watch white people from the better neighborhoods nearby walk their dogs down our
block to let the animals shit on our curbs-“Scoop the poop, you bastards!” my roommate would shout with
impressive rage, and we’d laugh at the faces of both master and beast, grim and unapologetic as they
hunkered down to do the deed.
 I enjoyed such moments-but only in brief. If the talk began to wander, or cross the border into
familiarity, I would soon find reason to excuse myself. I had grown too comfortable in my solitude, the safest
place I knew.
 I remember there was an old man living next door who seemed to share my disposition. He lived alone,
a gaunt, stooped figure who wore a heavy black overcoat and a misshapen fedora on those rare occasions
when he left his apartment. Once in a while I’d run into him on his way back from the store, and I would offer
to carry his groceries up the long flight of stairs. He would look at me and shrug, and we would begin our
ascent, stopping at each landing so that he could catch his breath. When we finally arrived at his apartment,
I’d carefully set the bags down on the floor and he would offer a courtly nod of acknowledgment before
shuffling inside and closing the latch. Not a single word would pass between us, and not once did he ever
thank me for my efforts.
 The old man’s silence impressed me; I thought him a kindred spirit. Later, my roommate would find him
crumpled up on the third-floor landing, his eyes wide open, his limbs stiff and curled up like a baby’s. A
crowd gathered; a few of the women crossed themselves, and the smaller children whispered with
excitement. Eventually the paramedics arrived to take away the body and the police let themselves into the
old man’s apartment. It was neat, almost empty-a chair, a desk, the faded portrait of a woman with heavy
eyebrows and a gentle smile set atop the mantelpiece. Somebody opened the refrigerator and found close
to a thousand dollars in small bills rolled up inside wads of old newspaper and carefully arranged behind
mayonnaise and pickle jars.
 The loneliness of the scene affected me, and for the briefest moment I wished that I had learned the
old man’s name. Then, almost immediately, I regretted my desire, along with its companion grief. I felt as if
an understanding had been broken between us-as if, in that barren room, the old man was whispering an
untold history, telling me things I preferred not to hear.
 It must have been a month or so later, on a cold, dreary November morning, the sun faint behind a
gauze of clouds, that the other call came. I was in the middle of making myself breakfast, with coffee on the
stove and two eggs in the skillet, when my roommate handed me the phone. The line was thick with static. 
 “Barry? Barry, is this you?”
 “Yes…. Who’s this?”
 “Yes, Barry…this is your Aunt Jane. In Nairobi. Can you hear me?”
 “I’m sorry-who did you say you were?”
 “Aunt Jane. Listen, Barry, your father is dead. He is killed in a car accident. Hello? Can you hear me? I
say, your father is dead. Barry, please call your uncle in Boston and tell him. I can’t talk now, okay, Barry. I
will try to call you again….”
 That was all. The line cut off, and I sat down on the couch, smelling eggs burn in the kitchen, staring at
cracks in the plaster, trying to measure my loss.

 At the time of his death, my father remained a myth to me, both more and less than a man. He had left
Hawaii back in 1963, when I was only two years old, so that as a child I knew him only through the stories
that my mother and grandparents told. They all had their favorites, each one seamless, burnished smooth
from repeated use. I can still picture Gramps leaning back in his old stuffed chair after dinner, sipping
whiskey and cleaning his teeth with the cellophane from his cigarette pack, recounting the time that my
father almost threw a man off the Pali Lookout because of a pipe….
 “See, your mom and dad decided to take this friend of his sightseeing around the island. So they drove
up to the Lookout, and Barack was probably on the wrong side of the road the whole way over there-”
 “Your father was a terrible driver,” my mother explains to me. “He’d end up on the left-hand side, the
way the British drive, and if you said something he’d just huff about silly American rules-”
 “Well, this particular time they arrived in one piece, and they got out and stood at the railing to admire
the view. And Barack, he was puffing away on this pipe that I’d given him for his birthday, pointing out all the
sights with the stem, like a sea captain-”
 “Your father was really proud of this pipe,” my mother interrupts again. “He’d smoke it all night while he
studied, and sometimes-”
 “Look, Ann, do you want to tell the story or are you going to let me finish?”
 “Sorry, Dad. Go ahead.”
 “Anyway, this poor fella-he was another African student, wasn’t he? Fresh off the boat. This poor kid
must’ve been impressed with the way Barack was holding forth with this pipe, ’cause he asked if he could
give it a try. Your dad thought about it for a minute, and finally agreed, and as soon as the fella took his first
puff, he started coughing up a fit. Coughed so hard that the pipe slipped out of his hand and dropped over
the railing, a hundred feet down the face of the cliff.”
 Gramps stops to take another nip from his flask before continuing. “Well, now, your dad was gracious
enough to wait until his friend stopped coughing before he told him to climb over the railing and bring the
pipe back. The man took one peek down this ninety-degree incline and told Barack that he’d buy him a
replacement-”
 “Quite sensibly,” Toot says from the kitchen. (We call my grandmother Tutu, Toot for short; it means
“grandparent” in Hawaiian, for she decided on the day I was born that she was still too young to be called
Granny.) Gramps scowls but decides to ignore her.
 “-but Barack was adamant about getting his pipe back, because it was a gift and couldn’t be replaced.
So the fella took another look, and shook his head again, and that’s when your dad picked him clear off the
ground and started dangling him over the railing!”
 Gramps lets out a hoot and gives his knee a jovial slap. As he laughs, I imagine myself looking up at
my father, dark against the brilliant sun, the transgressor’s arms flailing about as he’s held aloft. A fearsome
vision of justice.
 “He wasn’t really holding him over the railing, Dad,” my mother says, looking to me with concern, but
Gramps takes another sip of whiskey and plows forward.
 “At this point, other people were starting to stare, and your mother was begging Barack to stop. I guess
Barack’s friend was just holding his breath and saying his prayers. Anyway, after a couple of minutes, your
dad set the man back down on his feet, patted him on the back, and suggested, calm as you please, that
they all go find themselves a beer. And don’t you know, that’s how your dad acted for the rest of the tourlike
nothing happened. Of course, your mother was still pretty upset when they got home. In fact, she was
barely talking to your dad. Barack wasn’t helping matters any, either, ’cause when your mother tried to tell
us what had happened he just shook his head and started to laugh. ‘Relax, Anna,’ he said to her-your dad
had this deep baritone, see, and this British accent.” My grandfather tucks his chin into his neck at this 
point, to capture the full effect. “‘Relax, Anna,’ he said. ‘I only wanted to teach the chap a lesson about the
proper care of other people’s property!’ ”
 Gramps would start to laugh again until he started to cough, and Toot would mutter under her breath
that she supposed it was a good thing that my father had realized that dropping the pipe had just been an
accident because who knows what might have happened otherwise, and my mother would roll her eyes at
me and say they were exaggerating.
 “Your father can be a bit domineering,” my mother would admit with a hint of a smile. “But it’s just that
he is basically a very honest person. That makes him uncompromising sometimes.”
 She preferred a gentler portrait of my father. She would tell the story of when he arrived to accept his
Phi Beta Kappa key in his favorite outfit-jeans and an old knit shirt with a leopard-print pattern. “Nobody told
him it was this big honor, so he walked in and found everyone standing around this elegant room dressed in
tuxedos. The only time I ever saw him embarrassed.”
 And Gramps, suddenly thoughtful, would start nodding to himself “It’s a fact, Bar,” he would say. “Your
dad could handle just about any situation, and that made everybody like him. Remember the time he had to
sing at the International Music Festival? He’d agreed to sing some African songs, but when he arrived it
turned out to be this big to-do, and the woman who performed just before him was a semi-professional
singer, a Hawaiian gal with a full band to back her up. Anyone else would have stopped right there, you
know, and explained that there had been a mistake. But not Barack. He got up and started singing in front
of this big crowd-which is no easy feat, let me tell you-and he wasn’t great, but he was so sure of himself
that before you knew it he was getting as much applause as anybody.”
 My grandfather would shake his head and get out of his chair to flip on the TV set. “Now there’s
something you can learn from your dad,” he would tell me. “Confidence. The secret to a man’s success.”

 That’s how all the stories went-compact, apocryphal, told in rapid succession in the course of one
evening, then packed away for months, sometimes years, in my family’s memory. Like the few photographs
of my father that remained in the house, old black-and-white studio prints that I might run across while
rummaging through the closets in search of Christmas ornaments or an old snorkle set. At the point where
my own memories begin, my mother had already begun a courtship with the man who would become her
second husband, and I sensed without explanation why the photographs had to be stored away. But once in
a while, sitting on the floor with my mother, the smell of dust and mothballs rising from the crumbling album,
I would stare at my father’s likeness-the dark laughing face, the prominent forehead and thick glasses that
made him appear older than his years-and listen as the events of his life tumbled into a single narrative.
 He was an African, I would learn, a Kenyan of the Luo tribe, born on the shores of Lake Victoria in a
place called Alego. The village was poor, but his father-my other grandfather, Hussein Onyango Obamahad
been a prominent farmer, an elder of the tribe, a medicine man with healing powers. My father grew up
herding his father’s goats and attending the local school, set up by the British colonial administration, where
he had shown great promise. He eventually won a scholarship to study in Nairobi; and then, on the eve of
Kenyan independence, he had been selected by Kenyan leaders and American sponsors to attend a
university in the United States, joining the first large wave of Africans to be sent forth to master Western
technology and bring it back to forge a new, modern Africa.
 In 1959, at the age of twenty-three, he arrived at the University of Hawaii as that institution’s first
African student. He studied econometrics, worked with unsurpassed concentration, and graduated in three
years at the top of his class. His friends were legion, and he helped organize the International Students
Association, of which he became the first president. In a Russian language course, he met an awkward, shy
American girl, only eighteen, and they fell in love. The girl’s parents, wary at first, were won over by his
charm and intellect; the young couple married, and she bore them a son, to whom he bequeathed his name.
He won another scholarship-this time to pursue his Ph.D. at Harvard-but not the money to take his new
family with him. A separation occurred, and he returned to Africa to fulfill his promise to the continent. The
mother and child stayed behind, but the bond of love survived the distances….
 There the album would close, and I would wander off content, swaddled in a tale that placed me in the
center of a vast and orderly universe. Even in the abridged version that my mother and grandparents
offered, there were many things I didn’t understand. But I rarely asked for the details that might resolve the
meaning of “Ph.D.” or “colonialism,” or locate Alego on a map. Instead, the path of my father’s life occupied
the same terrain as a book my mother once bought for me, a book called Origins, a collection of creation
tales from around the world, stories of Genesis and the tree where man was born, Prometheus and the gift 
of fire, the tortoise of Hindu legend that floated in space, supporting the weight of the world on its back.
Later, when I became more familiar with the narrower path to happiness to be found in television and the
movies, I’d become troubled by questions. What supported the tortoise? Why did an omnipotent God let a
snake cause such grief? Why didn’t my father return? But at the age of five or six I was satisfied to leave
these distant mysteries intact, each story self-contained and as true as the next, to be carried off into
peaceful dreams.
 That my father looked nothing like the people around me-that he was black as pitch, my mother white
as milk-barely registered in my mind.
 In fact, I can recall only one story that dealt explicitly with the subject of race; as I got older, it would be
repeated more often, as if it captured the essence of the morality tale that my father’s life had become.
According to the story, after long hours of study, my father had joined my grandfather and several other
friends at a local Waikiki bar. Everyone was in a festive mood, eating and drinking to the sounds of a slackkey
guitar, when a white man abruptly announced to the bartender, loudly enough for everyone to hear, that
he shouldn’t have to drink good liquor “next to a nigger.” The room fell quiet and people turned to my father,
expecting a fight. Instead, my father stood up, walked over to the man, smiled, and proceeded to lecture
him about the folly of bigotry, the promise of the American dream, and the universal rights of man. “This
fella felt so bad when Barack was finished,” Gramps would say, “that he reached into his pocket and gave
Barack a hundred dollars on the spot. Paid for all our drinks and puu-puus for the rest of the night-and your
dad’s rent for the rest of the month.”
 By the time I was a teenager, I’d grown skeptical of this story’s veracity and had set it aside with the
rest. Until I received a phone call, many years later, from a Japanese-American man who said he had been
my father’s classmate in Hawaii and now taught at a midwestern university. He was very gracious, a bit
embarrassed by his own impulsiveness; he explained that he had seen an interview of me in his local paper
and that the sight of my father’s name had brought back a rush of memories. Then, during the course of our
conversation, he repeated the same story that my grandfather had told, about the white man who had tried
to purchase my father’s forgiveness. “I’ll never forget that,” the man said to me over the phone; and in his
voice I heard the same note that I’d heard from Gramps so many years before, that note of disbelief-and
hope.

 Miscegenation. The word is humpbacked, ugly, portending a monstrous outcome: like antebellum or
octoroon, it evokes images of another era, a distant world of horsewhips and flames, dead magnolias and
crumbling porticos. And yet it wasn’t until 1967-the year I celebrated my sixth birthday and Jimi Hendrix
performed at Monterey, three years after Dr. King received the Nobel Peace Prize, a time when America
had already begun to weary of black demands for equality, the problem of discrimination presumably
solved-that the Supreme Court of the United States would get around to telling the state of Virginia that its
ban on interracial marriages violated the Constitution. In 1960, the year that my parents were married,
miscegenation still described a felony in over half the states in the Union. In many parts of the South, my
father could have been strung up from a tree for merely looking at my mother the wrong way; in the most
sophisticated of northern cities, the hostile stares, the whispers, might have driven a woman in my mother’s
predicament into a back-alley abortion-or at the very least to a distant convent that could arrange for
adoption. Their very image together would have been considered lurid and perverse, a handy retort to the
handful of softheaded liberals who supported a civil rights agenda.
 Sure-but would you let your daughter marry one?
 The fact that my grandparents had answered yes to this question, no matter how grudgingly, remains
an enduring puzzle to me. There was nothing in their background to predict such a response, no New
England transcendentalists or wild-eyed socialists in their family tree. True, Kansas had fought on the Union
side of the Civil War; Gramps liked to remind me that various strands of the family contained ardent
abolitionists. If asked, Toot would turn her head in profile to show off her beaked nose, which, along with a
pair of jet-black eyes, was offered as proof of Cherokee blood.
 But an old, sepia-toned photograph on the bookshelf spoke most eloquently of their roots. It showed
Toot’s grandparents, of Scottish and English stock, standing in front of a ramshackle homestead, unsmiling
and dressed in coarse wool, their eyes squinting at the sun-baked, flinty life that stretched out before them.
Theirs were the faces of American Gothic, the WASP bloodline’s poorer cousins, and in their eyes one
could see truths that I would have to learn later as facts: that Kansas had entered the Union free only after a
violent precursor to the Civil War, the battle in which John Brown’s sword tasted first blood; that while one of 
my great-great-grandfathers, Christopher Columbus Clark, had been a decorated Union soldier, his wife’s
mother was rumored to have been a second cousin of Jefferson Davis, president of the Confederacy; that
although another distant ancestor had indeed been a full-blooded Cherokee, such lineage was a source of
considerable shame to Toot’s mother, who blanched whenever someone mentioned the subject and hoped
to carry the secret to her grave.
 That was the world in which my grandparents had been raised, the dab-smack, landlocked center of
the country, a place where decency and endurance and the pioneer spirit were joined at the hip with
conformity and suspicion and the potential for unblinking cruelty. They had grown up less than twenty miles
away from each other-my grandmother in Augusta, my grandfather in El Dorado, towns too small to warrant
boldface on a road map-and the childhoods they liked to recall for my benefit portrayed small-town,
Depression-era America in all its innocent glory: Fourth of July parades and the picture shows on the side of
a barn; fireflies in a jar and the taste of vine-ripe tomatoes, sweet as apples; dust storms and hailstorms and
classrooms filled with farm boys who got sewn into their woolen underwear at the beginning of winter and
stank like pigs as the months wore on.
 Even the trauma of bank failures and farm foreclosures seemed romantic when spun through the loom
of my grandparents’ memories, a time when hardship, the great leveler that had brought people closer
together, was shared by all. So you had to listen carefully to recognize the subtle hierarchies and unspoken
codes that had policed their early lives, the distinctions of people who don’t have a lot and live in the middle
of nowhere. It had to do with something called respectability-there were respectable people and not-sorespectable
people-and although you didn’t have to be rich to be respectable, you sure had to work harder
at it if you weren’t.
 Toot’s family was respectable. Her father held a steady job all through the Depression, managing an oil
lease for Standard Oil. Her mother had taught normal school before the children were born. The family kept
their house spotless and ordered Great Books through the mail; they read the Bible but generally shunned
the tent revival circuit, preferring a straight-backed form of Methodism that valued reason over passion and
temperance over both.
 My grandfather’s station was more troublesome. Nobody was sure why-the grandparents who had
raised him and his older brother weren’t very well off, but they were decent, God-fearing Baptists,
supporting themselves with work in the oil rigs around Wichita. Somehow, though, Gramps had turned out a
bit wild. Some of the neighbors pointed to his mother’s suicide: it was Stanley, after all, then only eight years
old, who had found her body. Other, less charitable, souls would simply shake their heads: The boy takes
after his philandering father, they would opine, the undoubtable cause of the mother’s unfortunate demise.
 Whatever the reason, Gramps’s reputation was apparently well deserved. By the age of fifteen he’d
been thrown out of high school for punching the principal in the nose. For the next three years he lived off
odd jobs, hopping rail cars to Chicago, then California, then back again, dabbling in moonshine, cards, and
women. As he liked to tell it, he knew his way around Wichita, where both his and Toot’s families had
moved by that time, and Toot doesn’t contradict him; certainly, Toot’s parents believed the stories that
they’d heard about the young man and strongly disapproved of the budding courtship. The first time Toot
brought Gramps over to her house to meet the family, her father took one look at my grandfather’s black,
slicked-back hair and his perpetual wise-guy grin and offered his unvarnished assessment.
 “He looks like a wop.”
 My grandmother didn’t care. To her, a home economics major fresh out of high school and tired of
respectability, my grandfather must have cut a dashing figure. I sometimes imagine them in every American
town in those years before the war, him in baggy pants and a starched undershirt, brim hat cocked back on
his head, offering a cigarette to this smart-talking girl with too much red lipstick and hair dyed blond and legs
nice enough to model hosiery for the local department store. He’s telling her about the big cities, the
endless highway, his imminent escape from the empty, dust-ridden plains, where big plans mean a job as a
bank manager and entertainment means an ice-cream soda and a Sunday matinee, where fear and lack of
imagination choke your dreams so that you already know on the day that you’re born just where you’ll die
and who it is that’ll bury you. He won’t end up like that, my grandfather insists; he has dreams, he has
plans; he will infect my grandmother with the great peripatetic itch that had brought both their forebears
across the Atlantic and half of a continent so many years before.
